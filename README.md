<center><p style="text-align: center;">Server Side Horror is a fully server-side and configurable mod that introduces ambient horror to your Minecraft world. It features only one jumpscare and a range of subtle and unsettling events. The mod also adds one new structure. Best of all, players don't need to install anything, which means you can put this on your server without the players even knowing it's there.</p>

<p>Q: How does this mod differ from From The Fog? <br>
A: While this mod includes a few events inspired by the story of Herobrine it doesn't exclusively focus on that. Server Side Horror mainly aims to make your world feel cursed (in the spooky good way)</p>

<p>Q: Do you plan on developing this mod any further? <br>
A: Yes, even tho this mod has been made as a submission for the 2025 Serverside Summer Modjam I do plan to continue developing this mod further and adding more events and features over time.</p>

<p>Q: How were the odds for the events calculated? <br>
A: I wanted everyone to experience each event at least twice in a two week minecraft faze but at the same time to not be spammed by the events. So I assumed that the most extreme two week minecraft faze will have 5 hours of playtime per day which means 15 in game days or 360000 ticks and from that assumption I kind of guesstimated the odds.</p>

<p>I made this mod as a submission for the <a href="https://neoforged.net/news/2025serversidesummer/">2025 Serverside Summer Modjam</a>. And I actually forgot about the jam and only remembered a week before the deadline, but I think the mod turned out pretty well in the end. It also forced me to learn new things and look at them from a different perspective. If you experience any bugs or other issues, please report them with a log.</p>
